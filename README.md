# üè¶ Bank Customer Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook that analyzes a banking dataset. The goal is to understand customer behavior and trends to inform decision-making for targeted services such as marketing campaigns, product offerings, and customer retention strategies.


Churn Modelling - How to predict if a bank‚Äôs customer will stay or leave the bank
Using a source of 10,000 bank records, we created an app to demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn. We accomplished this using the following steps:

1. Clean the data
By reading the dataset into a dataframe using pandas, we removed unnecessary data fields including individual customer IDs and names. This left us with a list of columns for Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Length of time as a Bank customer, Balance, Number Of Bank Products Used, Has a Credit Card, Is an Active Member, Estimated Salary and Exited.

2. Analyze initial DataFrame
Utilizing Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas, we next analyzed the data. We can see that our dataset was imbalanced. The majority class, "Stays" (0), has around 80% data points and the minority class, "Exits" (1), has around 20% datapoints. To address this, we utilized SMOTE in our machine learning algorithms (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). More on that later on.

In percentage, female customers are more likely to leave the bank at 25%, compared to 16% of males.

The smallest number of customers are from Germany, and they are also the most likely to leave the bank. Almost one in three German customers in our sample left the bank.

3. Machine Learning using 6 different models
We tested seven different machine learning models (and used six in the final application) to predict customer churn, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost.

As mentioned earlier, we also used SMOTE to handle issues with the imbalanced data on and we also use class_weight parameter and it works well

- Customer segmentation insights
- Target variable behavior analysis

## üìà Key Insights

Based on the analysis conducted in `bank_eda.ipynb`, here are some major findings:

- **Class Imbalance:** A strong imbalance in the target variable (`y`), with the majority of customers not subscribing to a term deposit.
- **Age Factor:** Older customers (especially above 60) are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
- **Previous Contacts Matter:** Customers who were previously contacted and had a positive outcome (`poutcome = success`) show a higher likelihood of subscribing again.
- **Contact Type:** Contacting customers via **cellular** phone leads to more subscriptions compared to telephone.
- **Duration Bias:** Longer call duration correlates with higher success, though this is a post-event variable and must be handled carefully in predictive modeling.
- **Job Influence:** Certain professions (e.g., **retired**, **student**) have higher subscription rates compared to blue-collar or unemployed individuals.
- **Education Level:** Customers with higher education levels have slightly higher conversion rates.
- **Month of Contact:** Most conversions occur during the months of **March**, **May**, **August**, and **October**.

> These insights can be used to refine marketing strategies and optimize campaign timing, audience targeting, and communication channels.

## üìä Key Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` (optional)
- `scikit-learn` (optional, for clustering or PCA)


This project focuses on building industry-level machine learning models to predict customer churn for a bank. Churn prediction helps businesses proactively identify customers who are likely to leave and take preventive actions.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: `resources/analytical_base_table.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `Exited` (1 = churned, 0 = retained)
- **Features**: Demographic and account activity features.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling Approach

- Used **industry-standard ML pipelines** for consistent preprocessing and modeling.
- Applied **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to ensure balanced class distribution across folds.
- Addressed **class imbalance** using:
  - `class_weight='balanced'` where applicable.
  - Custom **threshold tuning** for each model post-prediction.
- All models were serialized using `joblib` and stored in the `models/` directory.
